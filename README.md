I am currently learning MarkLogic Java client API. I will add all the sample code that I write in the learning and testing process to this repository. One class and it's test cases would cover one and only one concept. Every method will be tested using Junit, however, all the test cases would be integration test cases. The code expect MarkLogic application server at localhost:12000, you may change that in the environment configuration. I will try to not to use any third party library other than the MarkLogic Java Client and Junit in this project. Happy Learning!
